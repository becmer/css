# css

[css] is a rust crate that implements a CSS stylesheet parser and serializer. It uses the [cssparser](https://docs.rs/crate/cssparser/) crate. It wraps source code originally forked of the style source code from [servo](https://github.com/servo/servo). The great efforts and achievements of those at Mozilla that have built Servo are very much appreciated.

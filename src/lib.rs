//! # css
//!
//! A Rust library crate for parsing, manipulating and serializing CSS stylesheets.
//! Makes use of existing CSS parser logic from Servo.
//! Includes forks of code from Servo because these are unpublished on <https://crates.io>.
//! One use of this library is to minify CSS, as the serialized form it produces is minimal.
//! Another use is provide a crate that others can use for auto-prefixing CSS and to eliminate unused CSS.
//! The values of property declarations are currently stored as a string. Parsing property declarations is a monster job (in effect there are bespoke rules for every property). If you feel like helping...
//!
//!
//! ## Getting Going
//!
//!
//! ### To get started
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate css;
//! use css::Stylesheet;
//!
//! let some_css = "margin-left: 10pt; top: 20px;".to_owned();
//! let stylesheet = Stylesheet::parse(&some_css).expect("CSS was invalid");
//!
//! let mut destination = String::new();
//! // Don't write source-map and source-url comments if any are present in the stylesheet
//! let include_source_urls = false;
//! stylesheet.to_css(&mut destination, include_source_urls).expect("Failed to write to destination");
//! assert_eq!(&destination, "margin-left:10pt;top:20px");
//! ```
